FOOD README

The purpose of this section of the project is to outline those production techniques for growing, cultivating, husbanding, rearing, harvesting, slaughtering, butchering, preparing, cooking, and serving physical nourishment.  The intent is to enable anybody to produce more calories to be available to their own diet, or to render some greater portion of the existing environment's calories into an edible form for themselves, for example by having a goat turn calories from grass into calories of milk.
