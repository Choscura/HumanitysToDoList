FOOD README

The purpose of this section of the project is to outline those production techniques for growing, cultivating, husbanding, rearing, harvesting, slaughtering, butchering, preparing, cooking, and serving physical nourishment.  The intent is to enable anybody to produce more calories to be available to their own diet, or to render some greater portion of the existing environment's calories into an edible form for themselves, for example by having a goat turn calories from grass into calories of milk.

Major topics include:
  * foraging for food, including identifying hitherto unknown species and testing them for edibility
  * animal husbandry and the raising of livestock
  * plant husbandry and the raising of different crops
  * mycological colony cultivation, propogation, and harvesting
  * Hunting and fishing, with an emphasis on sustainable practices and wildlife population management
  * food preparation and processing, those steps between a harvested plant, animal, or orther organism's substances, and the presentation of those substances as a plate of food to a hungry eater
  * an array of diet options and a vocabulary of nutritional tools to assess the consumption and potential consumptions of the participants in this project <you the humonkey reading this>
