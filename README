HumanitysToDoList README

The purpose of this project is to identify those items, skills, methods, understandings, and conditions necessary to the continuation of human life, no matter what other factors may be applicable.  It is not the intent of this project to put people on other planets, it is simply regarded as inevitable that humans will attempt to do such things, and so this project is geared towards securing a basic level of infrastructure for environments such as that.  A successful outcome of this project is the availability of Italian and Thai food on the moon, the accomplishment of which necessitates sufficient mastery over the human condition that it should allow the human species to universally address conditions such as poverty and hunger, as well as income disparity, education, and perhaps even allow the human species to disabuse itself of obsolete notions of the supernatural.
