MORALITY README

The purpose of this section of the project is to giv a codified standard by which the morality of propositions can be objectively compared by the straightforward comparison of their elements and consequences.

Basically this part should have a 'moral engine' that can compute morality on the basis of propositions and provide a computational basis of morality for assessing the outcomes of decisions.
