MORALITY README

The purpose of this section of the project is to giv a codified standard by which the morality of propositions can be objectively compared by the straightforward comparison of their elements and consequences.

<<<<<<< HEAD
**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES**

Morality is a system for optimizing the consequences of conscious creatures, inasmuch as these affect happines (subjective assesment of well being), physical composition (non-subjective relative assessment of well-being) and capacity for decision making


=======
Basically this part should have a 'moral engine' that can compute morality on the basis of propositions and provide a computational basis of morality for assessing the outcomes of decisions.
