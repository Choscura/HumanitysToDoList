Disposal Readme!

This section of the project is dedicated towards processing of byproducts into usable commodities, generating desired effects, and mitigating undesired effects.

Basically, this is where all the technology surrounding waste processing will go.

Item #1: a biogas digester/collector.  I have a design in mind alread, based around 50 gallon plastic barrels outside a building with a bit of plumbing- essentially a digital garbage disposal that spits the solids and oils into the barrel outside, siphon off the metals with magnetics, and sort the non-biodegradable bits into a brick it can compress out
Basically, the way that would work is with a skimmer (to collect the lighter viscosity fluids that float up, ie, all the oils), strainers (to collect solids), and repeat the process in the barrel (ie, agitate it long enough and anything will digest that can- so the only things left to sort out are going to be the non-degradable stuff that gets in on accident).
but the barrel outside is two barrels- one outside right side up, the other inside upside down- and the top barrel, that is upside down, is the collection barrel, and as 
biogas is collected, it will rise up- visually indicating fill level- and it can be piped back into the house for use through pipes going through the same cut that the garbage disposal puts your waste out with, and at the bottom of the outer barrel will be a small spigot,
which will empty out the digested liquid- which you can use directly as fertilizer.

The explicit intent of this is to provide a backup source of power for the sun-tracking solar turbine by being able to run a steam-generating boiler to power the same turbine.

More to come!
